Program 1)The program, we print all integers that aren’t divisible by either 2 or 3 and lies between 1 and 50.

for i in range(0,51):

    if(i%2!=0&i%3!=0):

        print(i)
				--------
Program 2)The program takes a number n and prints and computes the series “1+2+…+n=”

n = int(input("Enter a Number : "))
series_sum = []
for i in range(1,n+1):
 series_sum.append(i)
 if i==n:
 print(i, end='')
 else:
 print(i,end=' + ')
print(' = ', sum(series_sum), sep='')
